        <h3 class="mb-3">Refresh Issue</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, when a MIDI file is selected for playback or if the playback page sits idle for too long, the user will have to navigate back to the upload page and re-select the file for it to play. The cause of this is unknown, as it does not happen consistently. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-12">
        <h3 class="mb-3">Measure Display</h3>
        <p>
          For most songs, when they are uploaded, the playback page will print out more clickable measures than are in the song. This means that, while the entire song can be skipped to, some measure buttons will not play anything, as they will attempt to skip a point where the song is over.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-12">
        <h3 class="mb-3">MIDI Playback Progress</h3>
        <p>
          There is currently no way to see the playback's location while it is playing. This could be added to a later iteration, but as of now, there is no way to see how far into the song the playback is.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-12">
        <h3 class="mb-3">MIDI Keyboard Delay</h3>
        <p>
          Some attendees of the Capstone Showcase pointed out to me that there was some delay between pressing a note on the MIDI keyboard and the tone playing. I imagine this is a limitation of the library or browser, but the project is not meant to be a tool for playing music live, so it should not be much of an issue.
        </p>

      <div class="col-12">
        <h3 class="mb-3">Lack of Record or Edit</h3>
        <p>
          This application only includes the ability to play existing MIDI files or play a MIDI keyboard. A user cannot record their own MIDI files or edit existing ones, but this functionality may be added in future releases. Peter Pan Junior Theater's current solution does have these features, so it would be preferred if they could be implemented.
